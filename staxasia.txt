For eager tech entrepreneurs, investors and supporting institutions in Sri Lanka’s fast evolving startup space, collective success is predicated upon the realization that this is a market that rewards novelty, action and differentiation. Not only are consumers both discerning and savvy, but they also have very low switching costs. As the window to win grows ever shorter, entrepreneurs need more shots at goal just as much as they need a safety net to experiment. In the startup scene, we often resort to the popular aphorism ‘fail fast, fail cheap’, which speaks to the need for companies to build a tolerance for failure — arguably, the one guaranteed event in the life of any entrepreneur. It may seem counterintuitive at first glance, but the greatest need of the moment is to create a culture that is unfazed by failure. By this is not meant the kind of monumental, ‘lose the shirt off your back’ type of failure. Rather, it is about building the necessary margin in our thinking and ultimately, social fabric, to allow for incremental failures to take place such that individuals are free to explore what works without being afraid to confront what does not — treating the latter as an opportunity to correct course. A budding techie might enter the startup scene with several pre-conceived notions about everything from prototyping to marketing but they must be prepared to rigorously test their hypotheses and allow for the small failures that signal a need to switch tracks. In this sense, ‘fail fast, fail cheap’ is the antidote to failing big. What does this mean for aspiring entrepreneurs? For starters, it means leveraging existing resources to validate, refine and secure buy-in for what seems like a promising idea. Local techies have easy access to tools like Google Forms for quick surveys to tap into their target market and app mock-up platforms to showcase designs. There is every opportunity at an early stage to either prime one’s startup for success or make mistakes with spare time to adjust course. A quick picture of success for a tech entrepreneur may look something like this: Validate an idea and its target market by using free survey tools in lieu of drawn-out legwork. Test popularity and inspire investor confidence by securing pre-release beta sign-ups via platforms like Facebook. These actions must be embedded in a willingness to ‘fail’ at an initial idea that does not prove as popular as expected or a target market that has already encountered a competing product — provided this exercise places entrepreneurs on the path to further improvement and differentiation. The idea of leveraging existing tools is linked to being resourceful with time and money. ‘Fail fast, fail cheap’ necessitates that startups increasingly push towards the Pareto Principle or the 80/20 rule in their thinking and actions. As the rule goes, 80% of our results stem from only 20% of our efforts. What entrepreneurs need to do is hone in on that 20%. If companies want to fail fast and reorient in a rapidly evolving space like tech, individuals need to consider what kinds of tradeoffs they are willing to make in order to facilitate that. For example, a startup’s founders may estimate that it would take 3 months of round-the-clock effort to pull together a functional prototype of their idea and attract the requisite buzz but they risk being outpaced by competitors in that time. The big question is whether there is a smaller subset of efforts or actions that will achieve comparable results in say, 3 weeks. If the 3-week run produces noteworthy results, it serves as a new benchmark for what is possible. If not, there is room to ‘fail fast’, change the work plan and push ahead with another 3-week run. The Pareto Principle also lends itself well to cost-side considerations — 80% of revenues are said to stem from 20% of customers. If this is proven true, what might be the best use of a startup’s limited pool of funds? An early-stage venture that restricts its sales focus to high-potential customers is better poised to ‘fail cheap’ — should the occasion demand it — than one that has doled out on an in-house marketing consultant. From an institutional vantage point, there needs to be a grassroots change in terms of incorporating IT entrepreneurship in educational curricula and inculcating at an early age, the culture of experimentation and incremental failure that makes for strong tech startups. However, the most immediate need for assistance is on the cost-side. Recently, SLASSCOM’s Startup Sri Lanka survey canvassed the most pressing needs of ~225 entrepreneurs, 23 government/industry bodies, and 16 investors — only to discover that ~57% of respondents considered the lack of affordable work space a key obstacle to the growth of a startup. The concept of shared workspaces is not unique. The first round of results from the 2015–16 Global Coworking Surveyestimates the number of coworking spaces worldwide at around 7,800; with current spaces serving 46% members than they did just 2 years ago. In addition to helping startups channel funds away from rent and overheads towards the 20% of efforts that entail actual development, co-working spaces lend a sense of legitimacy to startups, and contribute a platform for networking, trading and sharing skills. Sri Lanka’s tech ecosystem needs government actors to have a mechanism for selecting the best start-ups and providing them with shared spaces in which they have up to a year to incubate.

The Client was looking for ‘smart capital’ to fund their growth plans and engaged Stax to formulate an Information Memorandum (IM) and assist in pitching to potential investors. The
          Assignment We conducted several strategy sessions with the management team to gain clarity on their 10-year vision and to understand the type of investor best aligned with their objectives. We then conducted primary and secondary research to understand the dynamics of the Sri Lankan higher education market, and gauge best practices of higher education institutions globally. This engagement also required financial modeling to arrive at a valuation of the Company. The Benefits The IM has been shared with the short-listed investors, and two bids from PE firms are currently in-progress. The Finding Through our conversations and research, we were able to develop an IM which encapsulated the Client’s phased expansion strategy, growth drivers, and key milestones in achieving the vision for 2025. Our findings also informed the Client about strategies of global higher education providers, which can be adopted to gain competitive advantage.

From the ancient Greeks who journeyed to Epidauria seeking the healing deity Asclepius to modern healthcare consumers with their calibrated itineraries combining both medical treatment and leisure, medical tourism has been a feature of the ages. The industry has, however, gained special traction in the 21st century. Today, ever increasing numbers travel internationally for medical treatment, driven by the promise of quality care at an affordable price. The figures are well worth considering. In 2008, the global medical tourism industry encompassed at least 35 countries, serving over a million medical tourists annually. Each of these “tourists” coughed up a tidy $7,500–$16,000 per medical visit. By 2011, the medical tourism market served at least 3 million tourists. Between 2012 and 2020, the market is set to expand significantly. While some revenue estimates remain conservative, there is no doubt that medical tourism is dramatically changing the landscape of healthcare service provision and consumption. Source: “Sharing knowledge on topical issues in the Healthcare Sector,” KPMG International, May 2011.
Much of this growth expected in the years leading to 2020 may be attributed to the internationalization of techniques and procedures. Healthcare consumers now have the option of obtaining quality care with far shorter waiting periods at a fraction of the cost — a significant draw for the average medical tourist, who is either uninsured or underinsured. A Sizable Opportunity Exists in Asia The region to watch out for is Asia. As of 2012, Asia comprised 9% of the global market for medical tourism, a humble figure that belies significant growth potential. According to Patients Beyond Borders, destinations in Asia are among the most popular for medical tourism. Note: The 2014 MTI ranks 25 top-performing countries from Africa, Asia, Central America, Europe, Middle East, South America, and North America. Overall country selection was based on three criteria:  1.The most important countries for medical tourism as identified in the popular press and the literature. 2.The most important countries for medical tourism based on a global survey of 394 members from the Medical Tourism Association (MTA). 3.The most important countries for medical tourism based on a balanced geographical distribution. Among the region’s most highly demanded service offerings are cardiology, urology, gastroenterology, dermatology, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, dental, and cosmetic surgery. A significant driver is the prospect of low-cost procedures delivered at international standards of care. As of 2015, there are at least 439 hospitals across Asia accredited by the U.S.-based Joint Commission International (JCI). According to Patients Beyond Borders, individuals traveling to one of these providers in India, for instance, can expect a discount of 65%–90% on the cost of a comparable medical procedure in the U.S. In Thailand, a patient can expect a potential discount of 50%–70%. Even in Singapore, where the cost of living is measurably higher, medical tourists are offered a discount of 30%– 45% on the cost of comparable procedures in the U.S.3 Another reason for Asia’s popularity among medical tourists is the opportunity to satisfy individual needs on a spectrum from medical treatment to wellness tourism. On one end, there are service offerings aimed at treating or altogether curing a medical condition; ranging from extremely high-tech surgeries like transplants to relatively standard procedures such as hip replacements. On the other end, there are “fringe medical treatments” such as Ayurveda, acupuncture, and wellness spas for tourists who merely wish to maintain their health or prevent future medical problems. Prevention may be better than cure, as the adage goes, but the prospect of both is infinitely better. Increasingly, success stories on the higher end of the medical cure spectrum have resulted in particular countries developing a reputation for specific procedures. India, for instance, is an emerging leader in the area of cardiovascular care, thanks to providers like the Fortis Escorts Heart Institute. Initially founded by U.S.-trained cardiac surgeon Naresh Trehan, Fortis Escorts is staffed by a team of Western-trained specialists who perform 4,000 heart operations annually, with a mortality rate of 0.8% and an infection rate of 0.3%. The provider’s post-op statistics comfortably outperform the first-world averages of 1.2% and 1%, respectively. An open-heart surgery that might cost $60,000 in the U.S. is priced at $4,500 at Fortis Escorts.4Like most other hospitals in the medical tourism industry, Fortis Escorts is also given to hospitality. To expedite the arrival and stay of overseas patients and their attendants, the provider supplies visa assistance in coordination with the Indian foreign office, makes lodging and travel arrangements, provides airport pickup and even facilitates sightseeing. Currently, it is the patients from neighboring countries who make up the top five nationalities of medical tourists for any given destination in Asia. Even as the region ages, rising income thresholds bode well for the market. The ASEAN countries — Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Vietnam, Myanmar, Brunei, Cambodia, and Laos — currently make up the second-fastest growing economy in the region. Between ASEAN’s consumer base of 626 million and the trillion dollar economies of China, India, Japan, and South Korea, Asia is well-positioned in terms of both the demand- and supply-side of medical tourism. While the region itself provides the best prospects in terms of demand, it is important to harness the market beyond Asian shores. The rapidly aging American population, for instance, represents a promising market for Asian providers. An estimated 16 million Americans plan to travel abroad for medical care by 2017, representing a potential $30–$80 billion in spending. Currently, these customers are looking towards geographically proximate locations like Canada, Mexico, Costa Rica, and Brazil. For many of them, the costs of trans-pacific travel and the quality of procedures are a concern. Herein lies a significant opportunity for Asian providers. Stax’s Recommendations for Capturing the Market There is a lot of potential for the Asian medical tourism market, but capitalizing on it will require providers to develop clear strategies for patient outreach, both within the region itself and outside. Stax brings both experience and expertise to healthcare providers attempting to navigate the medical tourism market. Having completed over 80 engagements across the healthcare delivery ecosystem in the last 2 years alone, our experience covers the spectrum from growth strategy to due diligence. We cater to service providers in a number of areas, including Healthcare Services & Facilities, Healthcare Technology, Pharmaceuticals & Dietary, Medical Services & Managed Care, and Healthcare Information & Exchange. To capture the medical tourism market, we recommend: 1. Knowing where to compete The choice of geographic market is a key decision. In order to know how and where to compete, healthcare providers in Asia must understand their target customer and the feasibility of travel between regions. Patient outreach and marketing efforts will differ based upon whether the target customer is an uninsured/underinsured American looking for a cost-effective elective procedure coupled with a leisure trip or an Asian traveler seeking a quality surgical procedure unavailable within the geographic confines of their own country. 2. Developing clarity about the offering Rather than a “Jack-of-all-trades” approach towards capturing the market, healthcare providers should develop clarity concerning the main offering. Primarily, providers need to focus on an area where they have a comparative advantage in terms of performance. India, for instance, has cultivated clear offerings and a strong reputation as a market leader in the area of cardiac care. 3. Increasing transparency Patients have real concerns about the quality of medical care received in foreign destinations, as well as attendant medical risks. The only solution is for providers to increase transparency by collecting and sharing quality, comparative performance metrics in patient outreach. In our experience working with Healthgrades — the S.S. provider of information about physicians and hospitals to consumers — we discovered that the three most important things patients consider when selecting a doctor are experience (accuracy of diagnosis and frequency with which procedures of interest are performed), hospital quality (clinical outcomes of the hospital in question), and patient satisfaction (whether other patients recommend this doctor). As in the case of Fortis Escorts in India, countries and providers with well-documented registries of procedures, patient testimonies, accreditations, and performance data stand the best chance of showcasing their specialties and competing in the global market. 4. Being forward-thinking about partnerships An important strategy is for medical providers to think ahead about partnering with government and other institutions in building a healthcare ecosystem that enhances innovation. Singapore, in particular, has been successful in this area: emerging as a test-bed for partnerships leading to sophisticated new medical offerings. A noteworthy example is the Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s (TTSH) partnership with Swiss medical technology company Hocoma AG to develop and optimize equipment for robotic rehabilitation therapy in neurological movement disorders.5By becoming the first regional center to adopt the latest version of the LokomatPro — a robot-assisted walking therapy device — TTSH is now positioned to offer robotics and virtual reality programs alongside conventional rehabilitation therapies. 5. Planning for aftercare Aftercare is a vital component of the overall healthcare experience delivered to a patient. While providers must convince prospective customers about their experience and hospital quality, broader patient satisfaction also derives from what happens after a procedure. For the most part, the aftercare horizon will change based on the type of procedure sought. Compared to patients who receive dental treatment or a minor elective procedure, Asian providers will need to be proactive about associated patient follow-up and hospitality arrangements for medical travelers who undergo surgeries requiring a long recuperation period. For the customer, one of the perks of receiving healthcare in an Asian holiday destination is the prospect of convalescence in a resort environment. For the healthcare provider, it means exploring untapped opportunities within the hospitality sector.

Simply put, a “thing”, in the “Internet of Things” can be any natural or man-made object with an IP address and has the ability to collect, analyze and transfer data over a network without human intervention. The concept of IoT dates all the way back to the early 1980s when a Coca-Cola machine at Carnegie Mellon University in the U.S. was modified to become an internet-connected appliance that could measure and report — without human intervention — whether or not the drinks were cold. However, it is only now that IoT is gaining significant relevance and traction driven by the declining cost of sensors, increased connectivity and enhanced data processing power. Is it catching on in the Asian region? 
While estimates projected by multiple industry experts vary drastically, forecasters agree on one thing — IoT will see remarkable growth in the next few years. Experts estimate global growth to jump from 6–14 billion autonomous things in 2014 to 18–50 billion things by 2020, while the revenue opportunity of IoT is forecasted to be between $1 trillion to $7 trillion by 2020. These estimates reflect IoT’s capacity to transform both consumer and business applications in the near future. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region is set to become the frontline for IoT with an estimated 10 billion things connected, creating a market opportunity of over $2.6 trillion by 2020. “Smart Cities” government initiatives implemented by countries like India, Singapore, Malaysia, China and Indonesia, are driving the demand for IoT solutions that can reduce costs and enhance citizen services. While government initiatives are expected to lead the IoT sector, private investments in IoT within utilities, healthcare, retail and discrete manufacturing are also likely to see high growth. For instance, healthcare smart applications like wearable devices, remote patient monitoring and clinical trial applications are revolutionizing and improving the healthcare space in India, where the doctor to patient ratio is lower than the limits set by the World Health Organization (WHO). Have IoT investments really been successful? Innovation-hungry companies across various sectors are capitalizing on IoT opportunities. In fact, industry experts believe that by 2025, organizations that extensively invest and incorporate IoT technologies in their products and operations will be at least 10% more profitable than competitors that don’t. In 2015, IBM’s announcement of a $3 billion investment in a new IoT business unit and General Electric’s announcement that the company made $6 billion through their industrial IoT products further proved IoT’s revenue potential. Companies in the APAC region have been following suit. For example, XL Axiata — an Indonesian telecom operator — launched a separate IoT division that offers innovative IoT products and solutions. Savvy, a smart home solution, was launched by this division in February 2016 and has recorded over 360,000 registered connections after the first three months. The burgeoning IoT sector is also having a significant impact on the APAC startup ecosystem, with an increasing number of IoT startups receiving funding from both global and local investors. In October 2015, Qualcomm Ventures and Norwest Venture Partners invested $10 million in Chennai-based Attune Technologies, a cloud-based software provider that connects devices such as Intensive Care Unit (ICU) machines and lab analyzers to the health network. Moreover, some IoT-based startups are exhibiting impressive top line growth. Covacsis Technology — an Indian IoT startup focused on manufacturing plant optimization and backed by investors such as Cisco Systems — is seeing top line growth of 300–400%. Although the company was founded just seven years ago, the IoT solution is now being used by 25 of the top 100 manufacturing companies in India. What is the future of IoT in Sri Lanka? 
Sri Lanka is certainly not far behind this revolutionary charge. Several government initiatives aimed at capturing the full potential of IoT, big data and cloud computing to empower key public sectors including education, healthcare, urban development and finance have already been commissioned. This is evident with conceptual projects like Megapolis Smart Cities that involve the implementation of real-time traffic information systems, smart power grids and smart street lighting. Sri Lanka has also stepped into the utilities segment — the Ministry of Power and Energy launched a smart meter system in 2016 to the business community. These smart meter systems have the ability to track, monitor, and report granular utility usage data without any human intervention. This concept not only enables the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to reduce its peak power generation charges by pushing consumers to shift electricity use to off-peak hours, but also helps replace the costly, traditional model that requires regular home visits to read meters. Sri Lanka has long been recognized as a regional leader in terms of connectivity, innovation and incubation — as proven when Sri Lanka was the first country in South Asia to introduce commercial 4G services in 2014. Sri Lanka also boasts a mobile penetration of over 100% with the market rapidly shifting towards the Smartphone segment. Given that IoT solutions primarily rely on Smartphone use and connectivity, there is substantial runway for growth and adoption of IoT solutions in Sri Lanka. What can this mean for your business? 
As IoT adoption becomes a reality, Sri Lankan businesses must explore the relevance of IoT to their products and services and how they can best capitalize on potential opportunities in the space. In order to enter the space and reap quick returns, it is critical for firms to make fact-based, informed decisions based on a clear understanding of not just market nuances and complexities, but also an honest assessment of in-house assets and capabilities.

_Thanushika Sivanathan is a Senior _ We'd like to hear about youdoctype html STAX- A Global Consulting Firm Driving capacity utilization for a retail client through in-depth data analytics The Situation The client—who had previously used Stax findings to increase member retention and service usage—required further study to drive value through optimization of its retail outlet capacity utilization. We sought to help the client devise strategies to maximize the volume and frequency of member utilization across the client’s network of over 800 retail locations. The
          Assignment Stax set out to identify operational inefficiencies in the client's three main asset groups, through analytics of company-wide transactional data spanning four years. Stax conducted: Comprehensive auditing and mining of large sets of client data—including sales, employee, outlet and appointment data. Data de-duplication and creation of unique identifiers to ensure accuracy of merges and the creation of a robust data set that would yield reliable results. In–depth analysis to identify under utilization and operational inefficiencies in services, agents and key assets. The Benefits Our study helped the client develop strategies and targeted messaging to optimize utilization of services, agents, and operational assets. These strategies resulted in increased membership and customer retention, higher frequency of member visits, and improved profit margins. The Finding Stax identified significant variations of franchisee (outlet) performance and utilization relative to one another for each asset group. This allowed the client to learn from well performing outlets and leverage successful ideas more broadly across the organization. We provided a set of tools to help monitor and benchmark better performing outlets, identified gaps in agent and service utilization, and made recommendations on ways to improve operational efficiency across each asset group.doctype html STAX- A Global Consulting Firm Helping an investor client with their shoe shopping The Situation In support of an Investor Client’s interest in two footwear companies, Stax evaluated current market demand and brand positioning of these two key footwear brands As part of this assessment, Stax sought to determine market conditions and outlook, end-user dynamics and competitive positioning and brand positioning. The
          Assignment Stax orchestrated a broad analysis of secondary research by gathering and analyzing publicly available industry data to assess market trends and drivers. Furthermore, Stax conducted primary and secondary research to deliver a granular assessment of the two competitor brands. We supplemented our findings with interviews with category managers to round out our market and customer assessment. The Benefits Stax identified and outlined growth opportunities for both the targets to increase sales and improve brand perception and positioning. Stax recommended that Target 1, should focus on improving its relationship with primary retailers and improve its in-store experience in discount retail stores through bigger assortments and stronger in-store signage. Furthermore, we recommended that Target 2 improve product assortments and in-store signage which are in tandem with customer service in order to improve the consideration-to-conversion rate of potential customers. The Finding The market for athletic footwear was expected to have a moderate growth over the next 3–5 years, given rising disposable incomes and demand for evolving technology. Additionally the basketball and running shoes segments were strong contributors to overall growth. Target  1 was seen to be more ready to be elevated in the  discount retailer space given its brand recognition and price-to-value proposition, and was unlikely to be competitive with market leaders in specialty stores. We also found that the 2nd Target’s  brand aligned well with department stores where customers were seeking a strong price-to-value proposition in tandem with quality and durability. Stax recommended that Target 2 should continue to focus on its presence in department stores as its products align well with current and potential customers.doctype html STAX- A Global Consulting Firm A blueprint for disruption in SL and beyond The Situation A leading bank in Sri Lanka required a comprehensive digital plan to break into to the disruptive mobile payments and digital banking space - both, within Sri Lanka and regionally. The
          Assignment Stax led a comprehensive study into available disruptive digital banking technologies both regionally and globally, while also encompassing a study into Sri Lankan digital consumer behavior and banking habits. Through this comprehensive study, Stax aimed to develop a comprehensive digital banking solution for our client, that encompasses an industry leading feature and convenience set, while also developing an actionable deployment plan for execution in local and regional markets, individually. The Benefits Our Client was able to prioritize and deploy investments to launch the digital banking service, based on a comprehensive understanding of customer need and potential for ROI. The Finding Stax provided a comprehensive view of the digital banking eco-system and the player level contribution, for our client to understand and prioritize the opportunity in the space. Stax developed a digital banking solution encompassing an eco-systemwide view of services and channel partners. This focuses on engaging a wider demographic that is looking to engage with banking services digitally. In addition to transaction-based revenues, the solution also encompassed channel-specific strategies that looked into driving up loan book values, asset base, and also cross-selling strategies into offline services. In terms of deployment, Stax prioritized industry and customer segments that should be targeted as a point of entry and also focused on how the deployment would evolve, to grow the business, over the next 3-5 years.doctype html STAX- A Global Consulting Firm Assessment of the domestic and international stationery market and adjacent market growth opportunities The Situation The largest stationery manufacturer in Sri Lanka was interested in identifying growth opportunities that best aligned with corporate strategy. They were interested in understanding the potential for growth in their current market as well as opportunities in adjacent markets. The Client was also interested in expanding into two regional markets. The
          Assignment We conducted phone interviews in the Sri Lankan market speaking to customers, retailers, and distributors of school and office stationery. This data was supplemented through secondary research. We also conducted research on the regional markets through in-depth secondary research. For market sizing, we also used primary research insights from on -the-ground partners. The engagement also involved conversations with the senior leadership team to ascertain their views on growth opportunities, facilitate further thinking, and gain clarity on the collective vision. The Benefits While Stax provided the Client with growth opportunities in adjacent markets, we also recommend that they should focus on further growing their existing business. Our findings were later used by the Client in pitching to potential investors to gain equity investment. The Finding We identified that despite being the market leader in the stationery market, there was still room to capture further share in a highly fragmented space. Furthermore, adjacent markets such as e-commerce and packing appeared to be attractive over the next five years. Of the two regional markets, we found that one presented a significantly better opportunity to our Client due to its large and growing market size, lack of a dominant stationary brands, and favorable trade agreements with Sri Lanka.doctype html STAX- A Global Consulting Firm An A – Z on the US bath ware and tile market The Situation A corporate Client in the ceramic and tile industry  was interested in expansion opportunities in the US bath ware and tile market. While the Client had basic understanding of the market dynamics, they wanted to identify high potential local markets, and channel partners they can work with. The
          Assignment Our engagement began with a state-level macro assessment to identify the five most attractive states for the bath ware and tile market. Thereafter, we gathered MSA level information using our proprietary databases, secondary, and primary research. Following the assessment, 8 MSAs were prioritized for a deep dive after which the Client choose 3 markets to execute its initial expansion. The prioritization was done based on, competitive dynamics, availability of channels to market, cost of entry for each market, and other screening criteria. The Benefits Stax helped the Client formulate an execution strategy; assisting in getting the right product and pricing mix, selecting the best channels to market for each location, and recommendations on how to position themselves against competitors in each MSA. The Finding Our findings in the first phase of the engagement assisted the Client in validating their hypothesis on U.S. market entry. A deep-dive into the attractive MSAs enabled the Client to identify that each location would require a tailored entry strategy to yield best results.

More specifically, the Client was interested in understanding the market size (value and volume) of the branded pharmaceuticals, the competitor landscape, and how it is likely to evolve in the next 5–10 years. The
          Assignment We adopted a phased approach for this engagement. The initial phase involved gaining clarity on the objectives and reviewing the internal documents and financial models relevant to the project. Thereafter, we conducted ~120 conversations with patients, doctors, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and industry experts to build our fact-base in sizing the market and understanding the competitor landscape. We also leveraged proprietary and publicly available information to better understand the regulatory framework and how this impacts new players entering the market. The Benefits Based on our findings, the Client identified that there was a gap in their financial models, as the costs associated in establishing the brand had not been factored in. Furthermore, the Client recognized that solely targeting the private healthcare sector would not be feasible and that they would need to cater to the public sector as well. The Finding Despite the large size and potential of the branded generics market, our findings suggested that it would be difficult for a new entrant to penetrate into the market which is currently dominated by Indian brands. Furthermore, we identified that a large investment would be required to build the brand and channels, and to conduct clinical trials to assure quality.doctype html STAX- A Global Consulting Firm A Global

The
          Assignment The initial stages of the engagement involved conducting individual conversations with leadership team in the company to ‘define success’  and understand business needs of each party as well as gain their insight on potential growth opportunities. Concurrently, we conducted secondary research to find additional growth opportunities. ​ We then conducted initial filtering based on market dynamics and management perspectives. Thereafter, we established a set of screening criteria and developed a comprehensive screening tool to further refine the list of opportunities. At the end of this process, we presented the 10 most attractive opportunities to the management team at an ‘opportunity workshop’.​ Currently in-progress, the next phase of this engagement will involve a deep-dive on ~5 selected opportunities. The Benefits Our findings and recommendations have provided the Client with better clarity on opportunities that would best align with their vision for 2020. After the completion of the deep-dive phase, the Client will receive a granular execution strategy based on the selected opportunities. The Finding Based on our conversations and secondary research, we identified that ‘building the brand’ should be a key consideration for our Client over the next five years. To achieve this, we proposed an approach that would elevate the brand of the Client and differentiate it from traditional mass marketing competitors. In addition, we prioritized adjacent opportunities that the Client should pursue over the next five years to accelerate profitable growth.doctype html STAX- A Global Consulting Firm Giving an European tech firm a tour of India The Situation A European technology client sought to expand presence in India by tapping into the large and growing segment of small and medium-sized businesses in the country.

In phase two, based on our recommendations, the Client chose to design an entry-level product for which they commissioned  a survey to test the ideal product configurations and price point of such a technology in both China and India. The
          Assignment While qualitative data was a part of our approach, our Client needed a line of sight into the real tradeoffs their customers would make to purchase their product. In phase two, we conducted a web-survey of 300 Indian and Chinese mid-segment businesses leveraging on-the-ground teams to pursue these insights from respondents not easily accessible online. For each market, we simulated probable demand for an array of product bundles based on Conjoint or “Trade-Off” analysis. The Benefits Based on key findings and recommendations, the Client launched an entry-level device designed exclusively for the Indian mid-market segment in 2011.

However, along the way, weight on your decisions grew larger, and the cost of failure grew even more so. In a world of choices, decision fatigue became a daily struggle, where you are boxed in a present crisis, instead of building your organizations future. Data can be the key to this puzzle. Using the right data from your organization and deep learning (artificial intelligence), you can get better insights to navigate nimbly through complex decisions and automate the routine decisions. Moreover, utilizing our experience in sectors such as retail, financial services, hospitality, telecommunication and others; Stax has emerged with recurring applications of data-driven insights that made the most impact in our clients. Here are some insights from our work that has direct applicability to Sri Lankan businesses: 1.    Markets are driven by customers. Understand your customer!   Each transaction between your organization and customer leaves you with rich information that awaits discovery. Understanding different customer segments, their preference, and how these preferences change (momentum) can lead to more satisfied customers. From data usage in telecommunications to product purchases at the retail store, preferences change across demographics. A teenager will change their favorite drink every two weeks, yet a grandfather might have had the same ‘blend of tea’ every morning for twenty years. Making decisions without understanding these nuances of your customer preference was the tradition, but technology today can track all these changes in real time. 2.    Perception is key. Manage your brand!  Natural Language Processing can be your sentinel in the web, capturing the market sentiment of your brands, products and services. We can ask a bot to look for market perception around key attributes in your business; in case of a restaurant, they would be: food, wait time, ambience and service. You can have quicker reactions to negative perceptions of your brand and improve your business faster and leaner. 3.    Inventory is capital. Understand your products!  Keeping manual track of few hundred SKUs is already a challenge. Our organizations have millions. Data from the existing inventory management system at your organization can be used to generate richer insights into product holding time and variation in demand and supply. Aggregating fluctuations in demand-supply, marketing efforts at product level and preferences in customer segments; your inventory can be optimized to hold the required quantities. Nothing more, nothing less. 4.    Operational shortcomings can become crisis. Improve your logistics!  If your distribution network or sales team is a several thousand people spanning across the island, capturing the work at a glance is a challenge. Use data from existing systems to reach your teams and their progress faster. Further, big picture challenges such as efficient route planning, designing of incentive structures, and vehicle inventory can be optimized for efficiency with deep learning systems and become ubiquitous intelligence in your organization. Many other problems you face now can be just another challenge. Artificial intelligence can be used as a facilitator to make doing business more nimble and effective. It is an exciting time to have complex business challenges, because creativity and technology can overcome most problems.

We'd like to hear about youdoctype html STAX- A Global Consulting Firm Healthcare in Asia: Supply, Demand, and Deals by  Historically, per capita healthcare spend by Asian countries has been minuscule compared to that of mega-spenders like the U.S. or Norway. However, with an aging population, rising affluence, and demand for better health services in Asia, healthcare expenditure growth in the APAC region is set to outstrip North America’s. Healthcare spending in Asia is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 9.2% in the near term, compared to 5.6% in the U.S. In fact, growth of healthcare spending in many APAC countries has exceeded economic growth over the past few years, resulting in an increasing share of the economy being devoted to health. Between 2000 and 2012, per capita spending on health in Asia grew on average at ~5.6% in real terms, while GDP growth was at ~4.3%. Despite the substantial growth already taking place in the Asian healthcare industry, a lion’s share of M&A activity is still happening in the U.S., and only ~20% of global healthcare M&A activities in 2012–2013 were transacted in Asia. 2014 was a record year for healthcare M&A activity worldwide — nearly 2,500 deals took place at a total value of ~$412B. Once again, the U.S. dominated with ~66% of that activity being attributable to U.S. domestic deals. There are several reasons why investors may still be hesitant to focus on Asia — companies are relatively small and may not be in the right stage of growth, diligence is harder to perform, and politics and bureaucracy create barriers. However, there is much profit to be had for those who truly understand market needs and are willing to explore a variety of investment avenues, such as joint ventures or public-private partnerships. Demand Drivers Asia’s population is rapidly aging — boosting the need for services such as home health and hospice care, which are increasingly being demanded by this segment. The APAC region is currently home to ~300M people aged 65 or above — over half of the world’s total senior population. This number is growing rapidly due to improvements in life expectancy. As a result, Asia’s aging population is expected to reach~565M by 2030. Japan is home to the fastest-aging population in the world, with almost a quarter of its population being over the age of 65 — far more than in the U.S. and Europe. Hong Kong, China, Thailand, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore are also seeing a rise in their elderly populations. This trend will accelerate demand for healthcare products and services catered specifically to the 65+ segment. Many elderly patients prefer to be at home with their loved ones and are willing to pay for the convenience of home healthcare services. The global market for home healthcare is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.8% to reach ~$355B by 2020, with the APAC region expected to grow fastest at a CAGR of 9.7%. However, there have been just two home health and hospice related deals in Asia in the last two years, compared to 58 in the U.S. over the same period. A few fast-moving home healthcare providers in the U.S. have identified the gap in Asia and have already started to enter the space. For instance, in 2013, U.S.–based home healthcare firm Bayada purchased a 26% stake in Chennai–based India Home Health Care. This is the first investment outside the U.S. for privately held Bayada. Similar to the home health space, other products and services specifically for the elderly living alone — such as ambulance services, medical alert devices/Personal Emergency Response Systems (PERS), and animal companions — will also see growth. For instance, the global PERS space is set to reach ~$2B by 2020, with ~30% of that market value being derived from Asia. Asia is expected to be home to half of the global burden of chronic conditions by 2030 — a significant portion of the population that will require specialty care. Chronic diseases are the leading cause of mortality in the world — representing 63% of all deaths — and are growing faster in Asia than globally. In 2013, diabetes caused about 5M deaths worldwide, and over 60% of them occurred in the APAC region. The growing prevalence of diabetes and other chronic diseases — such as coronary heart disease and cancer — has created a need for specialty care facilities, wellness plans, healthy products, and health tracking/measuring devices. The APAC region is currently home to ~215M people who live with diabetes, and this number is expected to reach ~366M by 2030. Projections of significant growth within the region have spurred international players to pursue acquisitions and greenfield projects. For instance, KKR recently completed its biggest buyout in Japan to date by acquiring an 80% stake in Panasonic Healthcare — a provider of digital medical-record systems and instruments that measure blood glucose. With the increasing need to keep track of chronic disease data, Big Data analytics is also gaining momentum in the Asian healthcare industry, and specialized companies are already making use of this opportunity. For example, U.S.–based Truven Health Analytics, a provider of healthcare data analytics solutions and services, announced the opening of a Singapore-based regional head office to cater to the exponential adoption of patient and clinical data management technology in Asia. Furthermore, there is an increasing demand for wellness products in Asia — in 2013, of the top 10 fastest-growing markets for health and wellness packaged food, five were APAC countries. China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and India are significant growth markets that may be of interest to potential investors. Supply Constraints Although governments remain the main financier of healthcare in Asia, public budgetary constraints mean that more private sector participation will be necessary to meet demand. Governments in Asia, on average, finance ~48 % of total healthcare expenditure in the region (about the same percentage as U.S. public expenditures). This share has increased at a CAGR of just 0.7% in Asia since 2000, resulting in a significant role for the private sector in catering to the rapidly rising growth in demand. At 3.3 per 1,000 persons, the number of hospital beds in Asia is lower than the OECD average of 4.8, but with significant differences between countries — ranging from 13 beds per 1,000 population in Japan to 0.5 per 1,000 population in the Philippines. Private hospitals in the region are growing, however, and favorable government policies in several countries are also encouraging investments in state hospitals and public-private partnerships. For example, Seattle-based Columbia Pacific Management Inc. is investing up to $200M to construct two 250-bed multi-specialty hospitals in China. The investment came after China lifted restrictions on foreign-owned hospitals to improve healthcare and address the medical needs of a wealthier, aging population. Chinese authorities in 2014 set up a pilot program that allowed foreign investors in some parts of the country to set up hospitals or acquire existing ones. Also, in pursuit of lower-cost, higher-profit care options, providers in Asia are expanding outside of the traditional acute hospital setting into outpatient clinics and standalone surgery centers. Each of these areas, and more, represents possible growth and investment opportunities. Even with rising wages, healthcare is still expensive — especially since many Asian countries lack adequate health insurance plans. High medical costs coupled with low penetration rates of public insurance open up an opportunity for private insurance companies such as Cigna Corporation, which recently entered into a joint venture with Indian conglomerate TTK Group to sell health insurance products in India. Conclusion The trifecta of rapid growth in demand, inadequate supply, and low deal activity makes Asia an ideal target for healthcare investors. As always, the devil is in the details, however — carefully screening these highly varied Asian markets for specific strategic growth opportunities will be vital for those wishing to capitalize on the massive healthcare investment potential in Asia. Healthcare buyout deals in Asia by PE funds have risen steadily since 2011. However, even with growth projections and trends being so favorable for the healthcare industry in Asia, overall M&A activity has continued to be heavily focused on the U.S. It is estimated that there are ~350 healthcare-specific funds based in the U.S., with only about 15 specialized health funds being operated out of emerging markets. One reason for this is that deal sizes and depth in emerging regions like Asia are considered insufficient for specialized funds. This has resulted in sector-agnostic funds taking on the opportunity to invest in healthcare opportunities in fast-growing emerging markets. Given that healthcare companies and practices tend to be far more fragmented in Asia than in the U.S., deals are often at an earlier stage of the lifecycle, and more likely to attract venture capital over PE funds. Indeed, over the past three years, more than 55% of all healthcare deal activity in Asia has been VC-backed. The fragmentation in the space also means, however, that there is far more opportunity for consolidation and buyouts. As the region’s healthcare market continues to mature, informed investors who understand which Asian countries and healthcare sub-sectors to focus on, at which time, will be able to benefit from this opportunity-laden investment environment. There is ample potential for strategic players of all sizes to drive organic growth in Asia. Furthermore, there is scope for equity sponsors to back (or acquire) small, fast-growing companies individually or in combination (through consolidation), as distribution channels emerge and the entire ecosystem grows. With the substantial growth and variability between markets and customer groups, the keys to success in Asia lie in understanding the nuances of markets, opportunities, and risks, and in determining where to build and invest in organic growth versus where to acquire and ride the wave of market growth on current infrastructure. The opportunities are significant. The question is how best to realize them. We'd like to hear about youdoctype html STAX- A Global Consulting Firm Project

They intended to use Stax’s findings to help structure their corporate banking and retail lending offerings. The Target had just been acquired by our Client, having undergone a prolonged spell as one of the smaller players in the banking sector. There was confusion regarding their positioning in the market, their target Clientele and the general lack of public awareness about the company’s network and product offerings. The
          Assignment We broke this project into two parts, corporate and retail. Corporate included having individual conversations with over 80 of the country’s biggest corporates on their banking needs including trade services, pain points and what they were looking for from their bank in terms of service and products. We also studied the proposed 5+1 proposed hub strategy and how it would impact the Target company. On the retail side, we assessed 5 different retail lending products in terms of attractiveness to the Target. The Benefits By utilizing our reports, our Client will be able to approach each potential corporate banking Client with products and services that would cater to their exact requirements. We were also able to identify gaps in terms of services that could be exploited by the Target company. The Finding Stax provided the Client with a deliverable which along with individual profiles on each company, rated them in terms of attractiveness to the Target. Stax also provided the Target with detailed insights on the hub strategy including which industries we expected to benefit from this initiative. On retail lending, using a mix of primary and secondary research, we were able to provide the Client with insights on the current and expected addressable market for each product, what potential customers looked for as well as competitor offeringsdoctype html STAX- A Global Consulting Firm Attracting ‘Smart’ Capital for Your Tech Startup by  Despite being relatively young, Sri Lanka’s tech startup ecosystem has witnessed tremendous growth over the past few years. Home to world-class human capital, an envious geographical location, an increasingly favorable business climate, and relatively superior infrastructure to other countries in the region, Sri Lanka is well poised to become a thriving startup hub. Tech in Asia’s recent article on ‘5 things you didn’t know about Sri Lanka’s startup scene’ sheds light on its underreported potential, and we at Stax could not agree more.
However, it is a reality that capital is a key issue hindering the growth of many local tech startups. While availability and access to capital are commonly spoken of, the critical juncture we are at makes it more pertinent to consider startups’ ability to attract capital — smart capital.
Attracting external funding is both an art and a science for companies at any stage of their lifecycle. In the case of startups, it’s not incorrect to say that it is more an art than a science. While many entrepreneurs place paramount importance on the science — valuing their business, this is just one piece of the puzzle. Merely having an impressive valuation won’t make investors take their checkbooks out. So what would? It is imperative to start thinking like an investor when embarking on the journey of raising capital. The biggest concern on most investors’ minds is risk — “Is the risk I’m taking worth it?”, “how will the startup manage its risk?”, and “what premium will I get for the risk I’m taking?” This essentially means that an investor wants to know the startup’s growth potential and whether his investment is worth the return he will get when he exits a few years down the line. Building confidence in the mind of your investors often begins with the equity percentage you are willing to offer. This is a delicate balance. Offer too much and you may indicate lack of belief in your business, offer too little and it won’t spark interest among investors. Thereafter, it essentially boils down to two things — how good your product is and how good your people are. A solid product with an attractive market opportunity, coupled with an experienced and passionate management team is a winning formula. Many tech startups inherently possess characteristics that can create risk premiums for investors, but in most cases these are not articulated in pitches. At Stax, we use our 5C methodology in value creation to identify subtle nuances of your business model to ensure maximum value potential is achieved. So you’ve got a potential investor who’s willing to provide you with the capital you require. But is this it? Is any money good money? In our experience, companies that witness exponential growth are generally ones that have attracted smart capital. Instead of viewing fund raising as an opportunity to receive cash, they have viewed it as an opportunity to expand their resources. These companies have selected investors who give them access not only to money, but also to experience, access to networks and/or geographies, mentoring, and guidance. Having the backing of strategic investors also give sophisticated investors the confidence in investing in your business should you go for subsequent rounds of funding. Many investors conduct diligence prior to making investment decisions. But it is also important for startups to conduct diligence on potential investors to ensure that they are the right strategic fit for the business. With over 20 years experience working on diligence and tech-related projects for both the buy-side and the sell-side, Stax is able to guide you through the entire process of attracting smart capital and gearing your startup for exponential growth.
