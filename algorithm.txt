#extract all of the links (href values of <a> tags)

#keep track of the links we've already gone to so we don't go into it again

#text extractor module
#go to each page in the list generated by the link extractor module
#on each page extract the html and parse it through beautifulsoup
#iterate through all of the elements on the page and drop script elements...
#...head elements, title elements, and anything else that won't contain text...
#...or is irrelevant for this purpose
#take all of the text, combine it into a big paragraph of text
#then split it by a space delimiter into individual words stored in a list
#lowercase all of the words for consistency, and count the frequencies of each
#store the frequencies in a dictionary
#go to the next page and repeat and update the dictionary frequencies

#wordcloud
